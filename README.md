# PyCUDA primal-dual algorithms for TV/TGV-constrained imaging problems

Algorithms, examples and tests for denoising, deblurring, zooming, dequantization and compressive imaging with total variation (TV) and second-order total generalized variation (TGV) regularization. Python implementation with GPU acceleration using PyCUDA.

The code reproduces, in particular, the numerical experiments in the associated publication:

## Getting started

One easy way of getting started is to create a Python virtual environment, install the dependencies and to call a test script. For instance, run in the project folder:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_denoise.py
```

Please note that a working CUDA installation is required, in particular, a CUDA-enabled GPU. The test scripts are best run in an interactive environment such as `ipython` or `jupyter-notebook`.

```
test_denoise.py
test_denoise2.py
test_denoise3.py
test_deblur.py
test_deblur2.py
test_zoom.py
test_zoom2.py
test_dequantize.py
test_compressed_sensing.py
```

## Guided examples and figures

A Jupyter Notebook is available that guides through the examples and reproduces the figures in the above-mentioned publication.

```bash
jupyter-notebook examples.ipynb
```
